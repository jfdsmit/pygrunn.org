Jens is a software developer and data analyst at Optiver, a financial company - an electronic market
marker, to be specific. There, he uses Python to do availability and behavioral monitoring of automated
trading systems, as well as analysis of system behavior, such as chain-of-events reconstruction. Before
Optiver he was a server side software developer at Layar, where he learnt a thing or two about cloud
computing and about augmented reality. His overall specialty is tying stuff together.
